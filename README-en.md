# SmallWords

SmallWords is a desktop note-taking application designed to help you keep your thoughts organized and accessible. It's built with Python and Qt6.

## Features

- **Evergreen Structure**: Inspired by the concept of "Evergreen Notes", this application encourages writing notes that are atomic, concept-oriented, and linked to each other. This structure promotes continuous refinement and growth of ideas.

- **Cross-Platform**: Thanks to Qt6, SmallWords is a cross-platform application. You can run it on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Local Storage**: Your notes are stored locally. You have full control over your data, and you can access your notes without an internet connection.

- **Search and Navigation**: SmallWords supports powerful search and navigation features. You can easily find what you're looking for and navigate between related notes.

- **Markdown Support**: Write your notes in Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Markdown support makes it easy to format your notes and includes code, links, lists, and more.
